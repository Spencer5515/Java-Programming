package interfaces;

// has no code
// basically seems like '.h' file in C++
// functions as '.h' file for parent classes that do not correlate
public interface Info {
	
	public void showInfo();
}

// would be used to make single method for 2 classes that have the same parent but
// completely different methods, variables, and child classes
